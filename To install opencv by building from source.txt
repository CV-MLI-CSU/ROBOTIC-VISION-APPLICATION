#To install opencv by building from source:
#OpenCV can be used in python as C++ python binding. I am going to explain how to build #OpenCV from source and generate python binding.

#The steps needed to be taken in order to install OpenCV 3.4.0 are:

# Update and Upgrade and Cleanup (Required for error-free installation)
# Install Dependencies
# Download and Build OpenCV
# Update and Upgrade and Cleanup (Required for error-free installation)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
# Now that we have the updates ready, we are ready to install dependencies.

# Install Dependencies
sudo apt-get install build-essential 
sudo apt-get install cmake git libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev

# The following command is needed to process images:
sudo apt-get install python-dev python-numpy libtbb2 libtbb-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libjasper-dev libdc1394-22-dev

# To process videos:
sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev
sudo apt-get install libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev

# For GUI:
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev

# For optimization:
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev gfortran pylint

# To build OpenCV binding for both python 2 and 3.
sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev python3.5-dev

# We are now ready to download and build OpenCV on our Ubuntu machine.

# Download and Build OpenCV
# To Download OpenCV 3.4.0, go to terminal and type:
wget https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/3.4.0.zip -O opencv-3.4.0.zip

# To Download OpenCV Contrib 3.4.0 (Contrib has very useful algorithms which is a must for anyone working on Computer Vision), go to terminal and type:

wget https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/archive/3.4.0.zip -O opencv_contrib-3.4.0.zip

# We need to unzip to extract the zip files. Install unzip if not installed using the command:
sudo apt-get install unzip

# Now extract OpenCV and OpenCV Contrib:
unzip opencv-3.4.0.zip
unzip opencv_contrib-3.4.0.zip

# Make a directory named build inside OpenCV-3.4.0:
cd  opencv-3.4.0
mkdir build
cd build

# Now we are going to configure cmake:
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DOPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=../../opencv_contrib-3.4.0/modules -DOPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE=True ..

# The command will take some time to execute. Wait for few seconds.

# If the configuration is done without error, we will use make command to build.

make -j4 (where 4 is number of cores)

# This command will take a few minutes to complete. On my PC, it took about 20 minutes.

# Install in the location /usr/local using command

sudo make install

# Reinitialize static libs using the following command
sudo ldconfig

# Check if the OpenCV file exists
python2
“/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/cv2.so”
python3.5
“/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/cv2.cpython-35m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so”
python3.6
“/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/cv2.cpython-36m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so”


# Finally, check OpenCV version. Go to the terminal and typepython
# On the python terminal, type
import cv2
cv2.__version__

#DONE
